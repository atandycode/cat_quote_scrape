This simple project was to practice my git skills and also to refresh using BeautifulSoup in Python.
The premise was simple, I wanted to pull the quotes and authors from the following website 
(https://cattime.com/cat-facts/lifestyle/1470-25-famous-quotes-about-cats) and store within a csv
file to access later and simply copy/paste any I like.
